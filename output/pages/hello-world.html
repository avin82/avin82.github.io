    <p>Welcome to my blog.</p>

<h4>About me</h4>
<p>Call me Avin! I am Arvind Sharma, a software test engineer with keen interest in solving modern day problems with software engineering and data science skills acquired during a career break.</p>

<h4>What is the intent behind this blog?</h4>
<p>This blog started with the subtle realization that 'I do not know'. Only when I realized this as an immense possibility, this became a track and a roadmap to master computer science fundamentals along with data science exploration. It is now used to document my notes, projects, and also serves as my portfolio. </p>

<h4>Iâ€™ve been involved in the following endeavours recently:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Graduated with Python Foundation Nanodegree from Udacity.</li>
<li>Graduated with Data Analyst Nanodegree from Udacity.</li>
<li>Graduated with Data Scientist Foundations Nanodegree from Udacity.</li>
<li>Learning machine learning fundamentals from Udacity and other sources on the web.</li>
<li>Learning computer science fundamentals from web and other sources.</li>
<li>Using Linux as my daily driver operating system and working towards achieving 'Terminal Workflow Mastery'.</li>
<li>Intrigued by the term 'Full Stack Engineer' and started learning web development.</li>
</ul>
<hr>

<h4>I love to be an autodidact</h4>
<p>I have recently taught myself how to play the guitar by watching YouTube videos and from other web sources. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZD4MOYmW6o">Here</a> is my progress so far after a year of self-learning.</p>
