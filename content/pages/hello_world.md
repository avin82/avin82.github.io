Title: Hello world! 

Welcome to my blog.

#### About me
Call me Avin! I am Arvind Sharma, a software test engineer with keen interest in solving modern day problems with software engineering and data science skills acquired during a career break.

#### What is the intent behind this blog?
This blog started with the subtle realization that 'I do not know'. Only when I realized this as an immense possibility, this became a track and a roadmap to master computer science fundamentals along with data science exploration. It is now used to document my notes, projects, and also serves as my portfolio.
